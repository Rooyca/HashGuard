The File Integrity Guardian is a Python-based system designed to ensure the security and integrity of files stored on a server or network. It utilizes hash functions to calculate unique fingerprints (hashes) of files and stores them in a SQLite database. The system continuously monitors the specified files and detects any changes or modifications. When a change is detected, it sends real-time notifications to administrators, allowing them to respond promptly to potential security threats. The File Integrity Guardian provides an essential layer of protection, ensuring data integrity and safeguarding against unauthorized file alterations.
